💫 My Philosophy

- **Automation First** - Eliminating manual toil through declarative, code-driven approaches that ensure reproducibility and reduce human error
- **Infrastructure as Code & GitOps** - Managing all infrastructure and deployments through version-controlled, code-driven workflows with Git as the single source of truth
- **People Enablement** - Empowering teams through automation, clear documentation, and self-service capabilities that reduce friction and enable autonomy

🌱 Learning & Exploring

- **Music as Code** - Generating music through code and exploring multimodal agentic capabilities for music creation
- **Model Serving & Inference** - Efficiently deploying and serving ML models at scale with optimized inference pipelines and performance

🤝 Open to Collaboration

- **Generative Art, Interactive Installations, Visual-Audio Performance**
